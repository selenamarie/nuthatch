# Contributing to nuthatch

## See if an issue already exists and who is assigned

If an issue already exists and has someone assigned to it, do NOT take it over without asking for their approval.

## Do not send pull requests for new features without starting a conversation about it first

Not every feature will be accepted into the codebase for various design constraints. Please open an issue to start a discussion before doing work on it. Or fork the project and run it on your own server.

## Please try your best to match the formatting on the rest of the codebase

Other than that, we love contributions so if you're unsure where to start, feel free to ask the community!
